# Environment Variables for Vercel Deployment

## Required Environment Variables:
Copy these to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=demo_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=demo.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=demo
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=demo.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=demo_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=demo_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://ai-studyverse-pvml.vercel.app
```

## How to Add in Vercel:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/anshika-agrawal-s-projects/ai-studyverse-pvml
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Click "Environment Variables" in sidebar
4. For each variable:
   - Name: (copy from above)
   - Value: (copy from above)
   - Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
   - Click "Save"

## After Adding Variables:
- Go back to "Deployments" tab
- Redeploy latest deployment
- Variables will be available in build

## Why These Are Needed:
- Firebase configuration for authentication
- API keys for AI features
- App URL for proper routing
- Demo values work for testing

## Status Check:
✅ Variables configured → Build will succeed
❌ Variables missing → Build might fail

**Make sure all variables are added before deploying!**
